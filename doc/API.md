# API

All APIs supported by IoTAgent-Turtle can be found in the [OpenApi-Spec](https://github.com/FIWARE/CanisMajor/tree/master/api/api.yaml).

It essentially consists of two types (seperated by tag):
* Ops - basic APIs to support the operation of CanisMajor
* NGSI-LD - [NGSI-LD related](https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/cim/open/Latest%20release%20NGSI-LD%20API%20for%20public%20comment.pdf) endpoints to persist transactions
* Entity - endpoints to retrieve transaction information, based on the enities they relate to
